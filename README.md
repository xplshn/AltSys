# This is an experimental project.
### AltSys configures toybox+ubase+sbase (in that order) as your default coreutils, but without actually uninstalling them. This script was made for Void, but it might work on other systems.
##### I DO NOT TAKE ANY RESPONSABILITY FOR BREAKAGES, LOST OF FILES, ETC.
###### Do not mind the janky scripts I made to get sbase to work. (make install on sbase is done by a stupid, undocumented little piece of (POSIX)s**ll code)
