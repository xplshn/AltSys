#!/bin/busybox sh

# remove links that has been relocated or removed
# - generate a list of all symlinks in bin dirs and a list with all busybox
#   applets
# - sort the list and print all lines that are unique. This is the list of
#   symlinks that does not exist in the busybox applets list.
# - use stat to find the target of those symlinks printed as:
#     '/path/to/symlink' -> '/path/to/target'
#   The "2>/dev/null" is used to stop "can't stat" warnings appearing on
#   the console for each new command added by the new version of the
#   busybox package.
# - use awk to print the symlinks that points to '/bin/busybox'
# - use sed to strip the leading and training ' chars
# - finally pass the list to rm for removing the symlinks that points to
#   busybox but does not exist in the `busybox --list-all` list
